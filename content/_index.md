We are pleased to announce the **Numerical Methods in Quantum Chemistry**
workshop. 

In recent years there has been an increased interest in real-space numerical
methods for electronic structure calculations, such as wavelets, multiwavelets,
finite field and finite difference methods. Their development is now spreading
to a growing variety of applications.

The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers who either
made significant contributions to the field, or work within areas which are of
interest for the application of such methods. We hope that the workshop will
stimulate discussions on open problems, new ideas, and that it will promote
novel collaborations.

With an eye on the numerical methods perspective, the main themes of the
workshop will be:

- Molecular properties
- Relativity
- Correlated methods
- Large systems
- Computing, algorithms, architectures
- Time propagation
- Quantum computing and machine learning
