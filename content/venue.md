The workshop will be held in [Tromsø, Norway](https://www.visittromso.no/)

It will take place at UiT, The Arctic University of Norway.
The conference will start on Monday the 05.06.2023 at 9.00am and will terminate on Thursday the 08.06.2023 at 6.00pm. The event is structured as a series of *invited presentations*, a few *contributed presentations*, a *poster session* and a series of afternoon *tutorials* ranging from the theoretical foundations of numerical methods to practical applications, which we believe will be of interest for PhD students and young researchers. The program will be available shortly on our website.

To keep the conference as affordable as possible, we will not ask for conference fees and we will provide lunch for all participants during the four days of the conference. To promote participation for undergraduate and graduate students, we will offer a limited number of student accommodations free of charge, on a first-come-first-served basis.
