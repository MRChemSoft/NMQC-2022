Tick the **I wish to rent for a short period of time/Temporary housing** box.

Now you should see two options, one is a single bedroom apartment. The second
is a bedroom with shared bathroom and kitchen. Choose the solution that fits
your needs and preferences.

You will have to pay in advance. This will later be refunded to a limited
amount of students on a first-come first-served basis.
